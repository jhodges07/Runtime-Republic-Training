# ARCHITECTURE STATUS — Runtime-Republic Training

PHASE:
Phase 0 — Foundation (started 2026-10-30)

DIRECTION:
A training repository. It develops people's understanding of the AGCL, NBBF and NBEF
frameworks, AI and GitHub, and will create software that bridges the gaps so people can
work together asynchronously online to achieve the ideals of the AGCL (Human Engineer,
2026-10-30). Lessons are essays first, then narrated word for word as podcasts. Training
material teaches the frameworks but never sets their rules; the canonical control-document
repositories do.

CURRENT PRIORITIES:
- Human Engineer reviews and approves CONTROL 01, 02, 04 and 05 (all Draft)
- Supporting images: 5 Claude for Citizens, 5 Claude for Office Holders and 5 GitHub for Everyone lessons still pending
- Human Engineer sets lesson lists for the planned courses

COMPLETED:
- Repository created from Control-Engineering-Template
- Project initialized; CLAUDE.md adapted for a training repository
- CONTROL 01, 02, 04 drafted; CONTROL 05 Lesson Standard added
- CONTROL 03, 10, 15, 16 scoped to Phase 3 (software)
- Claude for Citizens course: 5 lessons in Draft, for citizens joining from Facebook or X
- Claude for Office Holders course: 5 lessons in Draft, nonpartisan, for state and local elected officials
- Claude for Office Holders bonus Lesson 06 (GitHub within the Open Meetings Act), Draft, image added
- Building With Claude course moved to private repo Lean-Office-Pro-LLC (business and developer content)
- Course pages for AGCL (NBLF), NBBF, NBEF (planned)
- GitHub for Everyone course: 7 lessons in Draft, 2 with images, brought over from PR #1 (closed)
- SOURCES.md and official CC BY 4.0 LICENSE brought over from PR #1
- scripts/check-lessons.sh with 10 tests, run in CI
- Learner README and CC BY 4.0 license notice
- The One-Hour Rule course: 5 lessons in Draft, images pending (Kansas bill transparency and KOMA)

NEXT:
- Approve the Phase 0 CONTROL documents (exit gate, CONTROL 02 §2)
- Phase 1: image standards; first framework course lessons
