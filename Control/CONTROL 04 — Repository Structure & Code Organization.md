`src/`, `tests/` and `docs/` do not exist until the narration pipeline is added (CONTROL 02 Phase 2).

# 2. Placement Rules

| If the file… | It goes in… |
|---|---|
| teaches one topic | `Courses/<course>/<NN-lesson-name>/lesson.md` |
| illustrates a lesson | the same lesson folder |
| narrates a lesson | `lesson.mp3` in the same lesson folder |
| configures narration | `audio.config.yml` or `pronunciations.yml` at the root |
| is a player page or the podcast feed | `docs/` |
| describes a course | `Courses/<course>/README.md` |
| sets a rule for this repository | `Control/` |
| checks the repository | `scripts/` |
| is software (narration pipeline, bridge software) | `src/`, by layer per CONTROL 10 |

---

# 3. Naming Rules

• Course folders: lowercase words joined by hyphens, e.g. `claude-for-citizens`.
• Lesson folders: two-digit order number, then lowercase hyphenated title, e.g. `01-from-turing-to-claude`.
• The order number is the lesson's place in the course and never changes once a lesson is approved.

---

# 4. Control Folder Rules

• File name: `CONTROL NN — Title.md`, two-digit number, em dash.
• Every document starts with the header block (title, Version, Date, Status)
  and ends with `END OF DOCUMENT`.
• Every document is listed in CONTROL 00.
• New documents start from `Control/_TEMPLATE — New CONTROL Document.md`.

---

# 5. Never Committed

Secrets (keys, certificates, `.env`, service config files with credentials),
build output, IDE user files, and every audio file except a lesson's own
`lesson.mp3` (CONTROL 06 §3.5). See `.gitignore` and CONTROL 16.
